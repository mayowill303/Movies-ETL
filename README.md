The purpose of this project is to create an automated pipeline that takes in movie data from Wikipedia, Kaggle and the MovieLens ratings. 

I performed extractions, transformations and loading of data into an existing PostgreSQL database.

I wrote an ETL function to read data, extract and transform the Wikipedia data, Kaggle and rating data then finally loaded the data to a PostgreSQL Movie Database.

I cleaned the data by filtering out the TV shows, consolidated redundant and formatted the data to create more user friendly versions of viewing and analyzing.
